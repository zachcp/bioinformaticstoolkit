title: "Quarto in Tauri"
self-contained: false

This is a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) that van be built as a [Tauri application](https://tauri.app/) and therefore interop with fast RUST code on your local client machine.


<br></br>


## Example Application

This simple example below shows almost everything you need to know to start getting up and running.

1. We import the `greet` function from a local file, `api.js`
2. In that file we also declare the `invoke` funciton which will let us pass JS into fast rust funtions.
3. We use reactive [OJS form](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/) to collect a name and send that to the Rust function.
4. The data is returned and displayed.


```{ojs}
import {greet} from "./api.js"

viewof name = Inputs.text(
    {label: "Name", 
    placeholder: "Enter your name", 
    value: "Ziggy",
    submit: true})

greet(name)
```

### The Code

```js
// this is required to interact with tauri
const { invoke } = window.__TAURI__.tauri;

// the greet function is called greet. it will `invoke` a Rust
// function called greet with a set of parameters
export function greet(name_str) {
  return invoke("greet", { name: name_str });
}
```


```rust
# The rust function looks like this.
# the tauri macro exposes the function

#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!", name)
}
```



## Setup 

The following setup assumes you have Quarto and Rust/Cargo installed.

```sh
# assuming
# install the tauri cli
cargo install tauri-cli

# add cargo bind dir to the path
export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin/

# to develop 
cargo-tauri dev

# to package
cargo-tauri 
```
